1) Read the Trace File Name and display the contents.

2) Available choices are -
i) Search via IP Address 
ii) Search via Domain Name 
iii) Input Output Graph Plot 
iv) Stastics of the Data in the Captured Trace File and Exit

3) Read choice

4) Choice 1:
	  i) Enter the corresponding trace filename
	 ii) Display the list of all IP Addresses available as source corresponding to the captured file
	iii) Read the IP Address to display its corresponding details
	 iv) If the IP Address entered does not match the available IP Address then read the IP Address again
	  v) In order to extract the details , we feed the IP Address to awk (line by line interpreter)	  
	 vi) The details corresponding to a particular IP Address include :
		-Time at which the packet was sent or received
		-Destination IP Address
		-Protocols
		-Length of Packet

   Choice 2:
	  i) Enter the corresponding trace filename
	 ii) Display the list of domain names(Source or Destination) corresponding to the captured file
	iii) Read the domain name(Source or Destination) to display its corresponding details
	 iv) If the domain name(Source or Destination) entered does not match the available source domain names then read the 		     domain name again
	  v) In order to extract the details , we feed the Domain Name(Source or Destination) to awk (line by line interpreter)
	 vi) The details corresponding to a particular IP Address include :
		-Time at which the packet was sent or received
		-Destination IP Address/Source IP Address
		-Protocols
		-Length of Packet
		-Information
	vii) The number of packets corresponding to source domain names or destination domain names are displayed

   Choice 3:
	   i) Read the filename with the Graph
	  ii) Display the Input Output Graph depicting the number of packets sent or received per second

   Choice 4:
	   i) Enter the filename
	  ii) Display the statistics of data in trace file
